Playable in a web browser, this JavaScript game was originally in a mobile app "shell."  Not being a *native* app, the game was a little clunky.

### Original game description:

>  "Conjecture!" is a cipher game where you have to correctly place objects in a specific position in order to solve the puzzle.  Similar to the board game "Mastermind," you will receive a hint after each guess on how to solve the puzzle.  Select the correct combination to win and play harder levels.  Race against the clock and your friends to test your deciphering skills!  How quickly can you beat the "Hard" mode?
